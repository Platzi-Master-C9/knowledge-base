# Contributing to RFCs

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Issues

Issues are not meant to be written in this repository, unless is a bug report for the generated site. If that is not the case, RFC are based on PR, those proposals will come from an issue indeed, but the issue is meant to be written in the repository of the project the RFC will be implemented. For example, lets say you would like propose a change on [backend-services](https://github.com/Platzi-Master-C9/backend-services), then you would open an issue there related to the proposal, after that is done you will follow the PR section and create the RFC. Any issue created in this repository will be closed.

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Copy `0000-template.md` to `RFCs/accepted/0000-my-feature.md` (where 'my-feature' is descriptive. Don't assign an RFC number yet).
3. Submit the PR using the content of the RFC as the description.

## Commits

Use [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when commiting.
