# Summary

This feature allows users, visitors and hosts, to see main statistics about the
another user that maybe interested in making a deal.

Further details about what kind of metrics should be displayed are given below.

# Basic example


# Motivation

This feature is suggested as it will offer a better UX. The user will be 
encouraged to close a deal when seeing top metrics from another user is a
smooth, automatic feature.

What is expected after implementing this feature is a higher chance of
success when booking a place as each user will know the other part is a 
serious and reliable person.

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with React to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- the impact on teaching people React
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- cost of migrating existing React applications (is it a breaking change?)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing C9 developers adopt it? Is
this a breaking change? Can we write a codemod? Should we coordinate with
other projects or libraries?

# How we teach this

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing C9 projects patterns?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the C9 documentation must be
re-organized or altered? Does it change how C9 is taught to new developers
at any level?

How should this feature be taught to existing C9 developers?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
