# Summary

The aim is to gather data to analyze how well is the website performing in terms of
engagement and conversion rate basically. To do so, traffic will be analyzed in order 
to get the information needed to meassure the performance of the website.

Also, this feature allows users, visitors and hosts, to see main statistics about the
another user that maybe interested in making a deal.

Further details about what kind of metrics should be displayed are given below.

# Basic example


# Motivation

"What is not meassured can't be improved"

Taking this quote as starting point and taking into account that data-driven
culture offers a big chance to enhance processes and profits in a company, the
data monitoring team wants to take care of some metrics that will give a detailed
view about the website performance and allow a better understanding of the user behaviour 
in order to make better choices that will make the business grow.

This feature is suggested as it will offer a better UX. The user will be 
encouraged to close a deal when seeing top metrics from another user is a
smooth, automatic feature.

What is expected after implementing this feature is a higher chance of
success when booking a place as each user will know the other part is a 
reliable person.

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with React to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- Availability of other free options such as frameworks or libraries intended to do so
- Usage of a third party tool that may concern user's data privacy
- 


There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

Frameworks such as ---

# Adoption strategy


As Google Analytics is a free, ready-to-use tool intended to analyze a website 
traffic, its implementation shouldn't be a major challenge, neither its
mainteinance or integration when other C9 teams may require our performance
metrics.


# How we teach this

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing C9 projects patterns?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the C9 documentation must be
re-organized or altered? Does it change how C9 is taught to new developers
at any level?

How should this feature be taught to existing C9 developers?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
