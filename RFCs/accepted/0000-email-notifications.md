# Summary

Use of the nodemail module with the purpose of sending email notifications

# Basic example

```js
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");

async function main() {
  let testAccount = await nodemailer.createTestAccount();

  let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: "smtp.ethereal.email",
    port: 587,
    secure: false,
    auth: {
      user: testAccount.user,
      pass: testAccount.pass,
    },
  });

  let info = await transporter.sendMail({
    from: '"Fred Foo ðŸ‘»" <foo@example.com>',
    to: "bar@example.com, baz@example.com",
    subject: "Hello âœ”",
    text: "Hello world?",
    html: "<b>Hello world?</b>",
  });

  console.log("Message sent: %s", info.messageId);
  console.log("Preview URL: %s", nodemailer.getTestMessageUrl(info));
}
```

# Motivation

Why we are doing this?

To facilitate the communication of different subjects of interest to the user using email notifications. These notifications could vary from booking updates, newsletter or even discounts of some places of interest for the user. It could be used in everything the user finds interesting.

What use cases does it support?

- Confirmation of bookings done by the customers.
- Informing the owner of a property if a customer has booked his/her property and the date that the user selected.
- Alerting the customer about info related to his/her account.
- Any information the customer could need using email communication

What is the expected outcome?

Offer a functional component / module and independent of other services that can be a part of the booking system.

# Detailed design

# Drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this?

- If the booking system needs to send a lot of emails daily, we should opt for a dedicated SMTP server.

# Alternatives

- **Mailgun:** It's a set of powerful APIs that allow us to send, receive, track and store email effortlessly.

- **Amazon SES:** Eliminates the complexity and expense of building an in-house email solution or licensing, installing and operating a third-party email service. The service integrates with other AWS services, making it easy to send emails from applications being hosted on services such as Amazon EC2.

- **EmailJS:** It allows sending emails directly from JavaScript without the need of a backend development. The developers creato one or more email templates and then trigger an email using the JavaScript SDK, specifying the template and the parameters for rendering the email.

# Adoption strategy

**If we implement this proposal, how will existing C9 developers adopt it?**

Because it's a independent module, everyone can use it if they need to send an email notification to an user in a certain moment.

**Is this a breaking change?**

No, because it doesn't interfere with any module of the booking system.

**Can we write a codemod?**

Yes, we can write codemods to automatize certain emails, for example, newsletters or publicity emails.

**Should we coordinate with other projects or libraries?**

Not necessary, because the only module we need in order to send the emails would be nodemailer.

# How we teach this

**What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why?**

- SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, it's the standar protocol used to send emails.

- nodemailer: A node.js module that allows us to send emails easily using SMTP.

**How is this idea best presented? As a continuation of existing C9 projects patterns?**

As a new component for the booking system, that allow us to send emails to the users (clients and owners of properties).

**Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the C9 documentation must be re-organized or altered?**

In certain extent, because we need to make sure that the squads of the booking system that could use this module know how to, for example, build a JSON object with the structured data of the email to be sent.

**Does it change how C9 is taught to new developers at any level?**

No, because it's a module designed to send emails easily, it has a lot of documentation and explains each part that compose the module, to understand how it works

**How should this feature be taught to existing C9 developers?**

Basically with examples of use and the documentation, as mentioned before, we could implement a template of a JSON object that every squad can use to send specific emails.
