# Summary

We will need a way to store and ensure privacy to our users. To enable that we have to create a way to encrypt data and design the way we are going to save data.


# Motivation
We need to ensure userâ€™s privacy, to ensure that we need to create a way to deliver messages to and only to its destination, encrypt messages, and store them in an efficient way.
# Detailed design


To create encryption I think it would be a great option to implement a system of public and private keys.

To be able to implement that first we need our clients to create and save their public and private key in cookies. Then send to us their public key and store them in our DB.

Now everyone has a way to encrypt and decrypt. We can send messages encrypted through the internet. The way to do that would be something like this

Why do we decrypt on the server?

Well because the public and private keys in client side would be stored in cookies where everyone can delete it. We could create a new one, but we couldn't decipher the previous messages.

Now to store messages I think a good point to start is to use pub/sub messaging due to is design to manage messaging systems, which would enable us to deliver correctly and efficient messages.
# 
# Drawbacks

We would increase workload on our server. Due to the fact that we have to decrypt and encrypt in our server for each message sent, before arriving at its destination, it adds more work to the server.

Privacy to be able to recover from delete cookies or change in dispositives would affect our client privacy due to the fact that we would have to save the messages without encryption.

The way of use redis is a little complicated and it could affect to be able to create our service.
# # Alternatives

An Alternative is to implement some symmetric algorithm which would facilitate the implementation but would not provide as much security.

some alternative protocols are:

-   DES
    
-   AES
    
-   IDEA
    
-   BLOWFISH
    
-   BLOWFISH
    
-   RC5
    
-   GOST
# # Adoption strategy

This implementation primarily affects the messaging team and is very important that front-end and back-end work together and in sync since it is a system that depends a lot on the two teams.
# How we teach this  
We should teach first messaging system team, and in time we begin to develop the system we should create the necessary documentation.
Obviously we need to teach another members of the booking system to be able to coordinate and add our advances with them
# Unresolved questions

How are we going to implement our scheme?

Will our team be able to implement it?

Encryption would be better in a different approach?

Which algorithm is better for encrypting messages in terms of performance and security.
